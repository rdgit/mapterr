	<li>What is it you want from me? / There isn't much I will not do.</li>
	<li>If it's only company / You know, I might need that too.</li>
	<li>Won't you</li>
</ul>
<ul class="ch">
	<li>Come anytime - I'm a man of leisure, / Come anytime, I await your pleasure.</li>

	<li>There's nothing new beneath the sun / We've butchered every sacred cow</li>
	<li>Don't tell me about all the things you might have done</li>
	<li>Just tell me what are you doing now - right now.</li>
</ul>

	<li>Come anytime, I won't give you pressure / Come anytime - I can wait forever</li>

	<li>Things like this happen every day / Whatever happens, it's O.K.</li>
	<li>Why be afraid when we've got it made - / I'll never ask you to explain.</li>
	<li>What is it you want from me? / You won't shock me easily.</li>
	<li>Maybe it's your heart's desire, / Maybe it's your wildest dream,</li>
	<li>Maybe I'm a gun-for-hire but, Baby, don't we make quite a team</li>
	<li> Don't we? / Don't we?</li>
</ul>
<ul class="ch">
	<li>Come anytime (you're so inclined) I won't give you trouble</li>
	<li>Come anytime (you're going blind) or you're seeing double</li>
	<li>And I have never been the kind who'd want to</li>
	<li>Burst your bubble.</li>
	<li>Come anytime.</li>
