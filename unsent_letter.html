	<li>I tried to talk to you</li>
	<li>And can't get past the weather</li>
	<li>The friend I thought I knew</li>
	<li>Found somethin' somewhere better</li>
	<li>So I'm hanging on your line</li>
	<li>Thought we could speak together</li>
	<li>Tell me what it is with you</li>
	<li>You seem gone forever</li>

<ul class="ch">
	<li>I'm spendin' all my time</li>
	<li>Driving 'round, fakin' clever</li>
	<li>With a girl who seems alright</li>
	<li>And another one who's better</li>
	<li>I don't know if I lied</li>
	<li>When I said we're not together</li>
	<li>But I try to talk to you</li>
	<li>Somehow, you seem gone</li>

	<li>I know what could have been</li>
	<li>Try not to think about it</li>
	<li>Found it hard to live with this</li>
	<li>And longed to live without it</li>
	<li>My dreams have caught me out</li>
	<li>I find myself surrounded</li>
	<li>By the odds of our own end</li>
	<li>Enough said about it</li>

	<li>I've given up something</li>
	<li>I guess that doesn't matter</li>
	<li>I've started other things</li>
	<li>I guess that doesn't matter</li>
	<li>I finally wrote your song</li>
	<li>Another unsent letter</li>
	<li>In a pile addressed to you</li>
	<li>Care of: Somethin' somewhere better</li>

	<li>Yeah, I try to talk to you</li>
	<li>Somehow, you seem gone forever</li>
