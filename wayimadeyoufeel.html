   <li>It started when I was cleaning dishes</li>
<li>And the phone rang in the hall</li>
<li>I was drawn to it against my wishes</li>
<li>Ugly memories of the war</li>
   
 </ul>

 <ul class="ch">
   <li>Didn't count on mass destruction</li>
<li>When I saw you</li>
<li>It was the way I made you feel</li>
<li>Hadn't seen such mass destruction</li>
<li>'Til I saw you</li>
<li>Was the way I made you feel</li>
 </ul>

 <ul class="v">
   <li>Went to town past the old caf√©</li>
<li>That existed to service the highway</li>
<li>And what they said for all these years was true</li>
<li>There never were good old days as such</li>
 </ul>
