   <li>Had a scratch only you could itch</li>
<li>Underneath the Glebe Point Bridge</li>
<li>And now every boy in a knitted vest</li>
<li>Has got some precedent</li>
<li>So we took a personality pill</li>
<li>And something red to swill</li>
<li>And now every fire has gone out</li>
<li>in every heart that wanted to kill</li>

  <li>Every thought that once had a sound</li>
<li>We'll have to hide 'til no one is around</li>
<li>'cause there ain't no room in the city today</li>
<li>For explanations that you just can't say</li>
<li>Found out what shame can mean</li>
<li>In purple sneakers and grey jeans</li>
<li>And every walked to a school that once made sense</li>
<li>Sure felt like an accident</li>
<li>Let's call it a day</li>

   <li>For every trouble you found</li>
<li>There's a drink to lose it and drown</li>
<li>But do you need somebody, to feel somebody?</li>

<li>To make damn sure that the twelve in you stays</li>
<li>But do you need somebody, to feel somebody?</li>
