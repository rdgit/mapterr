<ul class="v">
	<li>shelter from the storm</li>
	<li>'T was in another lifetime, one of toil and blood </li>
	<li>When blackness was a virtue and the road was full of mud </li>
	<li>I came in from the wilderness, a creature void of form </li>
	<li>"Come in", she said, "I'll give you shelter from the storm"</li>
</ul>
<ul class="v">
	<li>I was burned out from exhaustion, buried in the hail </li>
	<li>Poisoned in the bushes and blown out on the trail </li>
	<li>Hunted like a crocodile, ravaged in the corn </li>
	<li>"Come in", she said, "I'll give you shelter from the storm"</li>
</ul>
<ul class="v">
	<li>Suddenly i turned around and she was standin' there </li>
	<li>With silver bracelets on her wrists and flowers in her hair </li>
	<li>She walked up to me so gracefully and took my crown of thorns </li>
	<li>"Come in", she said, "I'll give you shelter from the storm"</li>
</ul>
<ul class="v">
	<li>In a little hilltop village they gambled for my clothes </li>
	<li>I bargained for salvation and they gave me a lethal dose </li>
	<li>I offered up my innocence, got repaid with scorn </li>
	<li>"Come in", she said, "I'll give you shelter from the storm"</li>
</ul>
<ul class="v">
	<li>Well i've heard new babies cryin' like a mournin' dove </li>
	<li>and old men with broken teeth stranded without love </li>
	<li>Do i understand your question, man, is it hopeless and forlorn? </li>
	<li>"Come in", she said, "I'll give you shelter from the storm"</li>
</ul>
<ul class="v">
	<li>And now there's a wall between us, somethin' there's been lost </li>
	<li>I took too much from granted, i got my signals crossed </li>
	<li>Just to think it all began on a non-eventful morn </li>
	<li>"Come in", she said, "I'll give you shelter from the storm"</li>
</ul>
<ul class="v">
	<li>Well i'm livin' in a foreign country, but i'm bound  to cross the line </li>
	<li>Beauty walks  a razor's edge, someday i'll make it mine </li>
	<li>If i could only turn back the clock to when God and her were born </li>
	<li>"Come in", she said, "I'll give you shelter from the storm"</li>
</ul>
