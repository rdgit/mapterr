	<li>Who'd like to change the world, who wants to shoot the curl</li>
	<li>Who gets to work for bread, who wants to get ahead</li>
	<li>Who hands out equal rights, who starts and ends that fight</li>
	<li>And not not rant and rave, or end up a slave</li>
	<li>Who can make hard won gains, fall like the summer rain</li>
	<li>Now every man must be, what his life can be</li>

	<li>So don't call, me, the tune, I will walk away</li>

	<li>Who wants to please everyone, who says it all can be done</li>
	<li>Still sit up on that fence, no one I've heard of yet</li>
	<li>Don't call me baby, don't talk in maybes</li>
	<li>Don't talk like has-beans, sing it like it should be</li>
	<li>Who laughs at the nagging doubt, lying on a neon shroud</li>
	<li>Just gotta touch someone, I want to be</li>

	<li>Who wants to sit around, turn it up turn it down</li>
	<li>Only a man can be, what his life can be</li>
	<li>One vision, one people, one landmass</li>
	<li>We are defenseless, we have a lifeline</li>
	<li/>
	<li>One ocean, one policy, seabed lies</li>
	<li>One passion, one movement, one instant</li>
	<li>One difference, one lifetime, one understanding</li>
	<li/>
	<li/>
	<li>Transgression, redemption, one island</li>
	<li>Our place mat, one firmament</li>
	<li>One element, one moment, one fusion</li>
	<li>Yes and one time</li>
